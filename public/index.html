            I had fun working my way through this course. It was more challenging than I thought it would be. Most of my prior experience with web dev was
            building React / Node apps, so getting back to the basics and writing vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS without libraries / frameworks was good for me.
            I realized I breezed past a lot of the fundamentals. I hadn't appreciated how complex writing plain old CSS can get. My CSS is pretty hacky and off-the-cuff
            right now. I'd like to read more about organizing (e.g. BEM) and maintaining growing style sheets. I'd also like to learn about tools like SCSS, SASS, LESS, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            I definitely made things harder on myself by electing early in the semester to deviate somewhat from the course recommendations and use some of my own tooling
            and infrastructure to support the site (remote dev and prod servers, accessing machines via SSH, integrating SSH with my IDE, building a back-end in Node.js, managing
            a custom domain / nameservers, versioning/git along the way, etc.). I learned a lot doing things this way, but it provided plenty to distract me from the core course content.
          </p>
          <p>
            The code on these pages has a lot of room for improvement, althought I'm quite happy with much of it. I wass guilty throughout the semester
            of using ES6+ and HTML5 features / syntax that prevents my pages from working properly in some browsers. I hope to either re-write the code I want to keep around
            or add the relevant poly-fills. Building React apps I grew pretty used to using newer features and counting on e.g. Webpack / Parcel or other build-time
            and pre-processing tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, I had a good time and learned quite a bit more than I thought I would!
