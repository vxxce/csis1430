            I had fun working my way through this course. It was more challenging than I thought it would be. Most of my
            prior experience with web dev was
            building React / Node apps, so getting back to the basics and writing vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS without
            libraries / frameworks was good for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I definitely made things harder on myself by electing early in the semester to deviate somewhat from the
            course recommendations and use some of my own tooling
            and infrastructure to support the site. I learned a lot doing things this way, but it did distract me a bit
            from the core course content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, I had a good time and am grateful for the experience!

          Hi! I'm Zach. This website was created for an introductory web-development course at SLCC.
          I'm a little embarassed by it now, truthfully. It's being hosted on heroku's free tier,
          so I've elected to leave it online for now. If nothing else, it's a reminder of how
          much I've grown as a developer since creating it!
