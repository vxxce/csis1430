          This course was more challening than I thought it would be. Most of my prior experience with web dev was building react apps, so getting back to the basics sans-libraries/frameworks was good for me. I definitely made things harder on myself by electing to use my own tooling and infrastructure to support the site (remote dev and production servers, custom domain set-up, SFTP tooling, versioning/git, etc.). I learned a lot doing things this way, but there was a lot of maintenance to distract from the core course content.

          I was guilty throughout the semester of using syntax that would break my pages in older browsers (ES6+ syntax, HTML5 feautures, etc.). I definitely need to go through and re-write that code or add the relevant poly-fills. Building react apps I grew pretty used to using newer features and counting on e.g. Webpack or other bundling and preprocessing tools to make my modern code work for not-so-modern browsers.

          Hi! I'm Zachary. I'm a first-semester student in the CSIS program at Salt Lake Community College. I also have a degree in Psychology from the University of Utah. I have taught myself a small bit of programming in my own time (mostly in Python and Javascript) but am otherwise new to world of Computer Science.

          Some of my other hobbies include painting (see <a id="paintings" href="https://zacharyolp.in/">here</a>), the board game "Go" (AKA Baduk or Weiqi), photography, camping, bookbinding, and cycling. I could never settle on a favorite film or book but the first two that come to mind are, respectively, Waking Life and Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst.
