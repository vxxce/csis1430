              Heya! I'm still working on my doubleknot+mosstone vid, but I wanted to make a quick
              informal video on this cool software in the meantime - it's pretty impromptu and not
              the best audio quality but I hope you still enjoy it!
            </p>
            <p>
              Let me know what you think in the comments and maybe I can do a series of videos
              exploring ORCA a little bit further and making some complete songs :)
            </p>
            <p>
              By the way, I didn't mention it in this video, but the couple who developed this
              software live in a studio on a sailboat, where they develop cool open source tools
              for artist! How rad is that?? :)
            </p>
            <p>
              Correction, by the way: ORCA uses Base 36 numbers, not 36-Bit, and l was thinking
              of UDP, not OSC (though it also has OSC capabilities).

            Artificial intelligence is getting smarter by leaps and bounds — within this century,
            research suggests, a computer AI could be as "smart" as a human being. And then,
            says Nick Bostrom, it will overtake us: "Machine intelligence is the last invention that
            humanity will ever need to make." A philosopher and technologist, Bostrom asks us to think
            hard about the world we're building right now, driven by thinking machines. Will our smart
            machines help to preserve humanity and our values — or will they have values of their own?

            disease as is diabetes.

              Abstract:
              <br>
              We describe a new training methodology for generative adversarial networks. The key idea
              is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively: starting from a low resolution,
              we add new layers that model increasingly fine details as training progresses. This both speeds
              the training up and greatly stabilizes it, allowing us to produce images of unprecedented quality,
              e.g., CelebA images at 1024². We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images,
              and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several
              implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and
              discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality
              and variation. As an additional contribution, we construct a higher-quality version of the CelebA dataset.
